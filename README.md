## Overview

Deepfake generation techniques have become increasingly realistic, making automated detection an important problem in digital forensics. While many deep learning approaches achieve high classification accuracy, most operate as black-box models and fail to explain **why** a video is classified as manipulated.

This project implements the **Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Video Transformer (ISTVT)** proposed in IEEE TIFS 2023. The model jointly models **spatial artifacts** within individual frames and **temporal inconsistencies** across consecutive frames using a transformer-based architecture while providing an interpretable explanation of its predictions through attention-based relevance visualization.

The implementation is developed in **PyTorch** and includes dataset preprocessing, face extraction, transformer architecture, training, evaluation, checkpointing and visualization modules.

# Architecture

The ISTVT architecture combines CNN-based feature extraction with Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning.

## 1. Face Preprocessing

Each video undergoes:

* Frame extraction
* Face detection using **MTCNN**
* Face cropping around the detected face
* Reflection padding when necessary
* Resize to **300 × 300**

Only facial regions are processed, reducing background noise and computational cost.

---

## 2. Xception Entry Flow

Each cropped face is passed through the Entry Flow of Xception.

Input

```
300 × 300 × 3
```

Output

```
728 × 19 × 19
```

Only the Entry Flow is used, as proposed in the original paper.

---

## 3. Patch Tokenization

Each spatial location becomes a transformer token.

```
19 × 19 = 361 tokens
```

Each token has

```
Embedding Dimension = 728
```

A learnable classification token is added to each frame before transformer processing.

---

## 4. Spatial Self-Attention

Spatial attention models relationships **within a single frame**.

For query **Q**, key **K**, and value **V**

The attention operation is computed as

```text
Attention(Q, K, V) = Softmax((QKᵀ)/√d) V
```

Multi-head attention enables the network to attend to different facial regions simultaneously.

---

## 5. Temporal Residual Attention

Unlike conventional temporal attention, ISTVT introduces the **Self-Subtract mechanism**.

Residual features are computed as

```text
Rₜ = Xₜ − Xₜ₋₁
```

These residual representations emphasize temporal inconsistencies introduced by deepfake manipulation.

Temporal attention is then computed over these residual tokens.

---

## 6. Transformer Encoder

Each encoder block consists of

```
LayerNorm
↓

Spatial Attention
↓

Residual Connection
↓

LayerNorm
↓

Temporal Attention
↓

Residual Connection
↓

Feed Forward Network
↓

Residual Connection
```

The transformer models both spatial and temporal dependencies.

---

## 7. Classification

The transformer output is aggregated through learnable classification tokens and passed through

```
LayerNorm

↓

Linear Layer

↓

Real / Fake
```

# Interpretability

One of the major contributions of ISTVT is **model interpretability**.

Instead of acting as a black-box classifier, the model generates spatial-temporal relevance maps indicating **where** and **when** the network focused while making its decision.

The visualization pipeline is

```

↓

Spatial Attention Rollout

↓

Temporal Attention Rollout

↓

19×19 Relevance Map

↓

Upsampling

↓

300×300 Heatmap

The resulting visualization highlights manipulated facial regions, making predictions more transparent and easier to interpret.
